## 🎯 Why I Built This App

As part of a real-world client project, I developed this app to replace outdated, manual HVAC inspection methods. The goal is to help companies conduct audits faster and more accurately, with a digital system that could scale across multiple teams and locations. 

It’s also a showcase of my ability to solve real business problems through practical app development, and I plan to market this solution to other HVAC auditing firms.
